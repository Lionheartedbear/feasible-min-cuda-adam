This is a ready to run single file that provides a concrete learning algorithm to a well-refined stochastic game problem. 
Due to confidentiality, I can not post the complete and real code that the research uses.
But this is a already a demo that features the graphical structure of a game with a enviornment-reward feedback.
It is not a simple fictitious play. it solves for equilibriums in a sysmatical way.

Just download the requied imported package list on the top of the file then you are good to give it a run.
